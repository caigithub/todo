# d README

## introduction
***.todo** is a **plain text** format that uses **self-defined symbols** to indicate **task status**.
You can edit it with any text editor, and **syntax highlighting** provides instant visual feedback.

The previous extensions ***.d** and ***.td** no longer supported.
To migrate, simply **rename** your files to **.todo** extension.

## usage
- begin a line with follow syntax :
```
    --<space>
        it will highlight the current block as done-style
    !!<space>
        it will highlight the current block as block-style
    ??<space>
        it will highlight the current block as question-style
    >><space>
        it will highlight the current line as action-style
    ++<space>
        it will highlight the current block as nice-to-have-style
```
